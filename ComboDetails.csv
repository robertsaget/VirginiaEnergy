Factor_A,Factor_B,Relationship
OPEC+ Cuts,Ukraine War,"Cuts tighten global oil supply on top of war-related disruptions, amplifying Europe's scramble for substitutes and raising marginal prices for U.S. fuels and gas via cross-fuel substitution."
OPEC+ Cuts,LNG Exports,"Higher oil prices (and shipping fuel costs) boost international gas demand and oil-indexed LNG pricing, supporting stronger U.S. LNG export volumes and upward pressure on Henry Hub."
OPEC+ Cuts,Dollar Strength,Oil is priced in USD; a cuts-driven oil shock can weaken risk appetite and the dollar (amplifying U.S. price impacts) or strengthen the dollar as a safe haven (partly offsetting pump prices). Net effect: adds FX-driven volatility.
OPEC+ Cuts,China Demand,"If China demand is soft, OPEC+ cuts try to floor prices; if China rebounds while cuts persist, price spikes are larger and transmit more forcefully to U.S. fuels."
OPEC+ Cuts,No New Refineries,"With limited U.S. refining capacity, higher crude costs translate more directly into higher gasoline/diesel prices; constrained capacity widens crack spreads."
OPEC+ Cuts,Aging Grid,Dearer diesel and fuel oil raise backup/maintenance and outage-response costs; higher gas demand from oil-to-gas switching can lift power prices.
OPEC+ Cuts,Pipeline Limits,"When crude prices rise, regional bottlenecks widen basis differentials, making localized price spikes worse and slower to clear."
OPEC+ Cuts,Transformer Shortage,Higher energy and petrochemical input costs plus pricier transport inflate transformer costs and lead times-slowing grid projects that could ease prices.
OPEC+ Cuts,Deferred Maintenance,"Price volatility and inflated O&M costs encourage cash preservation and push non-critical work out, increasing reliability risks and price spikes during stress."
OPEC+ Cuts,Permit Delays,"Higher prices spur more applications (production, pipelines, storage, generation), lengthening queues; delays keep new supply from relieving prices."
