"Electricity markets are not structured the same way in every state.

In regulated states, a vertically integrated, monopoly utility serves all customers in its territory, with generation, transmission, and distribution overseen by state regulators. Rates, resources, and project funding move through the state’s public utility commission to balance affordability, reliability, and policy goals.

In deregulated states, multiple suppliers compete to sell generation while the regulated utility maintains the wires. Prices for supply are set through the market, but decisions are still shaped by state policies, mandates, and regulatory oversight on safety, reliability, and the environment.

Virginia’s electricity market is a hybrid system, featuring regulated, vertically integrated utilities such as Dominion Energy, alongside limited retail choice for select customers. These utilities operate under State Corporation Commission oversight and General Assembly laws, which govern rates and resource planning.

As American Nuclear Society CEO Craig Piercy points out, Virginia's General Assembly may have missed an opportunity to join a growing number of states—and a national bipartisan consensus—that recognize #nuclear as essential to a reliable and clean energy future. Efforts to modernize the Virginia Clean Economy Act and create a technology-neutral clean energy standard didn't move forward during the session, but Governor Glenn Youngkin’s proposed amendments give the General Assembly another chance to join the rest of the nation in embracing nuclear as part of an increasingly clean energy future.

"Virginia was already on the path to cleaner energy long before the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA). By 2020, we had already cut carbon emissions by 50% voluntarily, through responsible planning and innovation.

While other states were just getting started on the low-hanging fruit, Virginia had already made harder cuts early on. Now, with technologies like small modular reactors, we can continue leading the way toward a reliable, cleaner energy future without sacrificing energy security.

""From Ground to Grid"" is a new series by Virginia Energy featuring insights from Director Glenn Davis on the most pressing issues in Virginia’s energy, mining, and geological sectors — from the resources under our feet to the power that fuels our communities. Stay tuned for more!

"Nuclear is the most powerful and efficient source of clean, emissions-free energy—producing significantly more electricity with less land and fewer resources than any other technology. While renewables are an important part of Virginia's energy future, they can't meet our state's ambitious climate goals and surging energy demands on their own. Smart investments in nuclear infrastructure will ensure Virginia's growing economy has the reliable, clean power it needs to thrive.

"“This important funding is already leading to positive changes in our coalfield communities that include Southwest Virginia, parts of the New River Valley, and around Richmond,” said Virginia Energy Director Glenn Davis. 

The Virginia Department of Energy is getting a third round of significant funding to reclaim abandoned mine land features across the Commonwealth. The agency will receive $22,779,530 through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Legislation, leading to more community development projects and job opportunities through the Abandoned Mine Land program. 

The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) and Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSMRE) made the announcement today that Virginia would receive the funding. The AML program reclaims features left behind by coal mining that occurred before 1977.

This year’s winners represent a cross-section of Virginia’s mineral mining industry, which continues to play a vital role in powering the Commonwealth’s economy. In 2024, Virginia’s mineral mining operations produced more than 70 million tons of materials valued at $1.9 billion (USGS estimate), employed over 10,000 Virginians, and reclaimed nearly 1,500 acres of mined lands—primarily for pasture (49%), commercial use (37%), and forestry (9%).

"This is what happens when energy policy prioritizes ideology over reliability: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) warns blackout risk could rise 100x by 2030 as states retire sources like gas and nuclear without adequate replacement. Even without retirements, outage risk could rise 30x because planned supply isn’t enough to match rising demand.

The Virginia Clean Economy Act mandates 100% renewables by 2045, and Virginia can’t afford the risks of renewable tunnel vision. Virginia will continue to invest in reliable baseload sources like nuclear and natural gas, alongside renewables and innovative technologies, as part of an all-of-the-above strategy to keep the power on and our communities safe.

 ? Nuclear, alongside renewables, accounts for zero carbon emissions.

 ? Nationally, coal remains a significant contributor to electricity generation, but in Virginia, only about 4% of our energy is derived from coal. Most of our coal is actually metallurgical and is used to produce steel and other products #metcoal
