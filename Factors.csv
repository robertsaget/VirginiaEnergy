Global Markets,OPEC+ Cuts,"When countries like Saudi Arabia and Russia cut oil production, the global supply tightens. Even if the U.S. produces plenty, Americans still pay more at the pump.","Saudi Arabia policy, Russian cooperation, demand forecasts",Global,"Refineries, Market Speculation, Dollar Strength"
Global Markets,Ukraine War,"Sanctions and supply disruptions forced Europe to replace Russian energy with U.S. oil and gas, creating ripple effects that raised global and domestic prices.","Sanctions, pipeline closures, LNG demand shift",Global,"LNG Exports, European demand, Grid stability"
Global Markets,LNG Exports,"Exporting natural gas strengthens U.S. geopolitical standing but ties domestic gas prices to global markets, raising winter heating costs at home.","Export capacity, Asian/European demand, shipping rates",National,"Ukraine War, China Demand, Pipeline Limits"
Global Markets,Dollar Strength,"Because oil is priced in dollars, shifts in U.S. currency values affect both export competitiveness and import costs for energy-related materials.","Fed policy, inflation, global trade flows",Global,"OPEC+ Cuts, Import costs"
Global Markets,China Demand,"When China's economy surges, global oil and gas demand spikes, and U.S. consumers feel the effect.","Economic growth, COVID policies, industrial output",Global,"LNG Exports, OPEC+ Cuts, Shipping"
Infrastructure,No New Refineries,"No major new refineries have been built since the 1970s, and several have closed. Even if crude oil is plentiful, limited refining means higher gasoline and diesel prices.","Environmental regulations, capital costs, demand uncertainty",National,"OPEC+ Cuts, Maintenance, Environmental rules"
Infrastructure,Aging Grid,"The U.S. electric grid needs massive upgrades to stay reliable and integrate renewables. Fixes cost billions, and utilities pass those costs on to consumers.","Deferred maintenance, renewable integration, demand growth",Regional,"Extreme Weather, Renewable Mandates, Cybersecurity"
Infrastructure,Pipeline Limits,Insufficient pipelines mean natural gas can't reach some regions cheaply. That's why heating bills in New England can be far higher than in Texas.,"Permitting delays, NIMBY opposition, environmental concerns",Regional,"LNG Exports, Permit Delays, State Conflicts"
Infrastructure,Transformer Shortage,The specialized transformers that power substations have multi-year wait times. Delays make the grid more fragile and expensive to upgrade.,"Supply chain issues, specialized manufacturing, raw materials",National,"Grid upgrades, Extreme Weather, Import dependencies"
Infrastructure,Deferred Maintenance,"During years of low prices, companies postponed repairs. Now, those deferred costs are coming due all at once.","2014-2020 oil bust, aging infrastructure, labor shortage",National,"Labor Shortage, Investment, Safety regulations"
Regulation,Permit Delays,"Building a pipeline, transmission line, or power plant can take years of review and lawsuits. Supply lags behind demand.","Environmental reviews, litigation, federal/state conflicts",National,"Pipeline Limits, Grid upgrades, Renewable projects"
Regulation,Dual System Costs,"As we build renewables, we still have to run fossil fuel plants for backup. Paying for two systems at once drives up rates during the transition.","Backup requirements, grid integration, stranded assets",National,"Renewable Mandates, Grid costs, Reliability needs"
Regulation,State Conflicts,"Each state sets different standards for renewables, reliability, and carbon emissions. This patchwork makes interstate energy trading less efficient and more expensive.","RPS standards, pipeline bans, grid rules, carbon policies",Regional,"Pipeline Limits, Renewable Mandates, Trading barriers"
Regulation,Carbon Rules,"Federal and state carbon rules add compliance costs, making older fossil fuel plants more expensive to operate.","EPA rules, state programs, investor pressure",National,"Stranded Assets, Investment uncertainty, Coal retirements"
Regulation,Renewable Mandates,State renewable portfolio standards require specific energy mixes. Integrating them reliably can add costs for storage and grid upgrades.,"State policies, technology costs, grid integration",State-level,"Dual System Costs, Grid upgrades, Storage needs"
Operations,Labor Shortage,"From oilfield workers to nuclear engineers to wind technicians, there aren't enough skilled people. Companies raise wages to compete, and costs get passed down.","Aging workforce, skills mismatch, competition from tech",National,"Wages, Maintenance delays, Project timelines"
Operations,Input Costs,"Steel for pipelines, concrete for plants, rare earths for turbines, polysilicon for solar panels — all more expensive. These costs show up in utility bills.","Inflation, supply chains, raw material costs",Global,"All infrastructure projects, Maintenance"
Operations,Cybersecurity,"After attacks like the Colonial Pipeline hack, utilities spend heavily on cyber and physical security, adding to overhead.","Nation-state actors, ransomware, critical infrastructure risks",National,"Insurance Costs, Grid reliability, Pipeline operations"
Operations,Rising Wages,"Inflation and competition from other sectors mean paychecks are growing across the energy industry, raising project and maintenance costs.","Labor shortage, inflation, union negotiations",National,"Labor Shortage, Skills Gap, Union contracts"
Operations,Skills Gap,Advanced technologies need specialized training. The lag in workforce development slows projects and raises expenses.,"Technology changes, training lag, workforce transitions",National,"Labor Shortage, New technologies, Safety issues"
Financial,Utility Monopolies,"Many states rely on a single regulated utility, with guaranteed returns that can encourage spending rather than efficiency.","Rate structures, guaranteed returns, regulatory capture",State-level,"Rate structures, Infrastructure spending, Regulatory policies"
Financial,Market Speculation,Hedge funds and traders betting on oil and gas amplify volatility. Consumers end up feeling price swings disconnected from actual supply.,"Hedge funds, commodity markets, algorithmic trading",Global,"OPEC decisions, Weather events, Supply disruptions"
Financial,Consolidation,"Fewer refineries, pipeline operators, and distributors mean less competition and more pricing power.","M&A activity, market power, barriers to entry",National,"Refinery capacity, Pipeline control, Market power"
Financial,Underinvestment,"After the 2014–2020 oil bust, shareholders pushed energy companies to prioritize profits over expansion. That means production doesn't ramp up quickly, even when prices spike. Years of cutting corners during low-price eras also left infrastructure weak, requiring costly upgrades now.","Investor caution, ESG pressure, capital discipline",National,"Grid, Pipelines, Refinery capacity, Production"
Financial,Stranded Assets,"Investors worry fossil fuel plants or pipelines will be shut down early by climate policy. To protect themselves, they demand higher returns, making projects more expensive.","Climate policies, technology change, investor concerns",National,"Carbon Rules, Investment decisions, Risk premiums"
Climate,Extreme Weather,"Hurricanes shut refineries, freezes choke gas supplies, heat waves strain the grid. Every major event spikes prices regionally or nationally.","Climate change, infrastructure vulnerability, peak demand",Regional,"Grid failures, Refinery shutdowns, Insurance"
Climate,Seasonal Spikes,"The gap between winter heating bills and summer cooling bills is widening, forcing utilities to build expensive backup systems.","Weather volatility, peak demand, storage limits",Regional,"Cooling Demand, Heating needs, Grid stress"
Climate,Droughts,"Hydropower and water-cooled power plants struggle in dry years, reducing supply and raising prices.","Climate patterns, water rights, competing uses",Regional,"Cooling Demand, Nuclear operations, Agriculture competition"
Climate,Insurance Costs,Insuring energy infrastructure in storm- and fire-prone areas is skyrocketing. Utilities pass those premiums into rates.,"Natural disasters, reinsurance markets, risk models",Regional,"Extreme Weather, Coastal facilities, Cyber risks"
Climate,Cooling Demand,"As populations grow in hotter regions, summer demand for air conditioning pushes grids to the limit and drives seasonal price hikes.","Population growth in hot areas, heat waves, building stock",Regional,"Population shifts, Grid capacity, Peak pricing"
